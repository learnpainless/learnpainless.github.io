You had started [learning Java](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Java-Patrick-Niemeyer/dp/0596008732%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0596008732 "Learning Java"), so its very important to know about features of java to become more friendly with java.

## <span style="color: #339966;">List of Features of java :</span>

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">Easy to use :</span>

1.  Java is easy to write and anyone can easily learn java.
2.  Java has many features which make java more simpler and easier.
3.  Most of java features are derived from [C++](http://isocpp.org/ "C++"), so anyone can learn java.

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">Portable:</span>

1.  Java can run on any [Platform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform "Computing platform") (Windows,Linux,Unix etc).
2.  Java can be run on any environment just we need to setup [JVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine "Java virtual machine").
3.  Java [program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") is easy to transfer without malware [execution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment "Capital punishment").

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">Secure:</span>

1.  Java is compiled into [byte-code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode "Bytecode") which are only executableÂ by Jvm, which makes it secure.
2.  Java program cannot hard other programs.
3.  Java is free from malware attacks.

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">Object Oriented:</span>

1.  Java is [Object Oriented Programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming").
2.  Like C++, java also provide features of OOPs.
3.  Java is not pure OOP, but it is considered as pure OOP language.

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">Robust:</span>

1.  Java is called as Robust Language because it is highly Supported Language.
2.  Its portable across many platform that's why its robust.
3.  Java has feature of automatic memory management and [Garbage Collection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29 "Garbage collection (computer science)").
4.  Java have strong type checking mechanism which makes java robust.
5.  Programs written in java crash less often.

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">[MultiThreaded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29 "Thread (computing)"):</span>

1.  Java provide multi-threading technology which increase speed of execution.
2.  Multi-threaded program takes less time to execute.

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">High Performance:</span>

1.  Byte-codes are much faster than other executors.
2.  JVM execute them faster.

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">Distributed:</span>

1.  Java programs can be run over internet directly.
