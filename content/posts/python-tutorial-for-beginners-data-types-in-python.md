In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

### Text Type:

str (String)

String datatype is used to store text values, for example name of person is a text, so datatype of this will be str, String value is represented using single quotes (‘’) or double quotes (“”). 

example

name = ‘Pawneshwer Gupta’

### Numeric Types:

int, float, complex

int

Interger datatype is used to store positive or negative numeric values without decimal. This means 10 or -10 is valid int values, but 10.0 is not valid int value.

float

float datatype is used to store positive or negative numeric values with decimal. Which means 10.0 or -10.0 is valid float values but 10 is not valid.

complex

### Sequence Types:

list, tuple, range

### Mapping Type:

dict (Dictionary)

### Set Types:

set, frozenset

### Boolean Type:

bool

### Binary Types:

bytes, bytearray, memoryview

### None Type:

NoneType
