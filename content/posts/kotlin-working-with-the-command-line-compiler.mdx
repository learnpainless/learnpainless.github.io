## Kotlin Working with the Command Line Compiler

In this tutorial we will create hello world application in kotlin using command line compiler from [Github release](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/) page.

## Download compiler

Every release ships with a standalone version of the compiler. we will download the newest version

### Manual Install

Unzip the standalone compiler into a directory and optionally add the bin directory to the system path. The bin directory contains the scripts needed to compile and run Kotlin on Windows, OS X and Linux.

### SDKMAN!

An easier way to install Kotlin on UNIX based systems such as OS X, Linux, Cygwin, FreeBSD and Solaris is by using [SDKMAN!](http://sdkman.io/). Simply run the following in a terminal and follow any instructions:

`$ curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash`

Next open a new terminal and install Kotlin with:

`$ sdk install kotlin`

### Homebrew

Alternatively, on OS X you can install the compiler via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

`$ brew update
$ brew install kotlin`

### [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) package

If youâ€™re on Ubuntu 16.04 or later, you can install the compiler from the command line:

`$ sudo snap install --classic kotlin`

## Creating and running a first application

1. Create a simple application in Kotlin that displays Hello, World!. Using our favorite editor, we create a new file called hello.kt with the following:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

2. Compile the application using the Kotlin compiler

`kotlinc hello.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar`

The -d option indicates the output path for generated class files which may be either a directory or a .jar file. The -include-runtime option makes the resulting .jar file self-contained and runnable by including the Kotlin runtime library in it. If you want to see all available options run

`$ kotlinc -help`

3. Run the application.

`$ java -jar hello.jar`
