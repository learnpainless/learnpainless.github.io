Are you preparing for a **Python interview**? Then you'll need to prepare to answer some technical questions about the programming language. Common **Python interview questions** include topics such as data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, coding style, debugging techniques, and software engineering best practices. Be sure to brush up on your knowledge before going into any interview!

 1. What is Python?
    * Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.
 2. What are the key features of Python?
    * Some key features of Python include its easy-to-read syntax, dynamic semantics, and support for multiple programming paradigms.
 3. What are the benefits of using Python?
    * Python offers many benefits including its ability to handle big data and its extensive standard library, which makes it easy to perform common tasks such as connecting to web servers and reading and writing files.
 4. What is the difference between Python and other programming languages?
    * Python has a unique style of indentation to define its code blocks, it is dynamically-typed, and it supports multiple programming paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, and procedural.
 5. What are the different types of data types in Python?
    * Python has several built-in data types including numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and booleans.
 6. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
    * A list is a mutable data type, meaning its elements can be changed, while a tuple is immutable and its elements cannot be changed.
 7. What is a dictionary in Python?
    * A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
 8. What is a function in Python?
    * A function in Python is a block of code that can be called and reused multiple times, and can take in parameters and return a value.
 9. What is an exception in Python?
    * An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions and requires special handling.
10. What is a decorator in Python?
    * A decorator in Python is a design pattern used to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. It is a way to wrap a function with another function to modify or add behavior to the original function.
11. What is the difference between xrange and range in Python?
    * xrange is a Python 2 function that generates a list of numbers on the fly, while range generates a list of numbers in memory. This makes xrange more memory-efficient when working with large numbers.
12. What is the use of '**init**' method in Python?
    * The '**init**' method in Python is a constructor method that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to set up or initialize the attributes of an object.
13. What is a module in Python?
    * A module in Python is a collection of functions, classes, and variables that can be reused across different programs.
14. What is the difference between 'is' and '==' in Python?
    * 'is' is used to check if two variables refer to the same object, while '==' is used to check if the values of two variables are equal.
15. What is the difference between a class and an object in Python?
    * A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class that has its own attributes and methods.
16. What is the difference between deep and shallow copy in Python?
    * A shallow copy creates a new reference to the same objects as the original, while a deep copy creates a new copy of the objects, so that changes to the original do not affect the copy.
17. What is the use of 'with' statement in Python?
    * The 'with' statement in Python is used to wrap the execution of a block of code with methods defined by a context manager. It is used to simplify the try-finally block and to ensure that resources are properly acquired and released.
18. What is the difference between a generator and an iterator in Python?
    * An iterator is an object that can be iterated (looped) upon, while a generator is a special type of iterator that is defined using a function.
19. What is the use of 'yield' keyword in Python?
    * The 'yield' keyword in Python is used in the body of a function like a return statement, but when the function is called, it returns a generator object. When the generator's next() method is called, the function is resumed and continues execution until a yield statement is encountered.
20. What is the use of 'lambda' function in Python?
    * The 'lambda' function in Python is used to create small, anonymous functions. These functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. They are often used in situations where a function is required for a short period of time.
21. What is the use of 'pass' statement in Python?

    * The 'nonlocal' statement in Python is used to indicate that a variable is non-local, and that it should be accessible from the enclosing scope, but not from the global scope.
26. What is the use of 'try' and 'except' statement in Python?
    * The 'try' and 'except' statement in Python is used to handle exceptions that may occur in the code. The 'try' block contains the code that may raise an exception, while the 'except' block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.
