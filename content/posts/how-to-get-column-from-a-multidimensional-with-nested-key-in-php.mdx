### Question : How to get column from a multidimensional with nested key in PHP

I have an array which is multidimensional. I have to pull a key as column but it is nested. like object accessing how to achieve this with minimum line of code or optimized.

```php
$array = [
    [
        'price' => [
            'cost' => 200, 'tax' => 10, 'total' => 210
        ],
        'otherKey' => 'etc'
    ],

    [
        'price' => [
            'cost' => 500, 'tax' => 50, 'total' => 550
        ],
        'otherKey' => 'etc'
    ],
    [
        'price' => [
            'cost' => 600, 'tax' => 60, 'total' => 660
        ],
        'otherKey' => 'etc'
    ],
];
```

#### using nested `array_column()` method:

```php
$result = array_column(array_column($array, 'price'), 'total');
printf($result); 
```

> array: \[
>
> 
> 0 => 210
>
> 
> 1 => 550
>
> 
> 2 => 660
>
> 
> \]

#### using `foreach` method:

```php
$result = [];
foreach ($array as $value) {
    $result[] = $value['price']['total'];
}
printf($result);
```

#### using use `array_walk_recursive()` method:

```php
$totals = [];
array_walk_recursive(
    $array,
    function($leafNode, $key) use(&$totals) {
        if ($key === 'total') {
            $totals[] = $leafNode;
        }
    }
);
printf($totals);
```

foreach is better way to do that even you can do a benchmark for performance you can have idea.

**Answers 2** : of How to get column from a multidimensional with nested key
The simple foreach should do the job, you could also write a function which takes a string as input, splits it and retrieves the values from the array.

It will only visit "**leafnodes**" so it spares you from needing to check if an element is an array or not.

### Multidimensional with nested key - A Multidimensional Column for holding multiplexed data!

Multidimensional data can be used to describe a lot of different things. For example, you can have a multidimensional column representing your customers and their relationship with your company. You can also have a multidimensional column that describes the amount of time you spent with each customer and the number of times you interacted with them.

### An Overview of Data Types That Can Be Used With Multidimensionality

Multidimensional data is a type of data that can be represented using more than two dimensions. This makes it possible to represent data in a way that is not just linear but also non-linear.

### How to Use String & Number Data Types and Various Calculations With Multidimensions

String and number data types are used in most applications today, such as in web development, mobile app development, etc.

### Data Type Examples for a Typical Database Mapping

In the past, a database was a collection of information stored in different physical locations. Nowadays, it is more like an idea or a representation of data. Data can be stored in databases and retrieved through queries and functions.
