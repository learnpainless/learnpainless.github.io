### Question : How to get column from a multidimensional with nested key in PHP

I have an array which is multidimensional. I have to pull a key as column but it is nested. like object accessing how to achieve this with minimum line of code or optimized.

```php
$array = [
    [
        'price' => [
            'cost' => 200, 'tax' => 10, 'total' => 210
        ],
        'otherKey' => 'etc'
    ],

    [
        'price' => [
            'cost' => 500, 'tax' => 50, 'total' => 550
        ],
        'otherKey' => 'etc'
    ],
    [
        'price' => [
            'cost' => 600, 'tax' => 60, 'total' => 660
        ],
        'otherKey' => 'etc'
    ],
];
```

#### using nested `array_column()` method:

```php
$result = array_column(array_column($array, 'price'), 'total');
printf($result); 
```

> array: \[
> 0 => 210
> 1 => 550
> 2 => 660
> \]

#### using `foreach` method:

```php
$result = [];
foreach ($array as $value) {
    $result[] = $value['price']['total'];
}
printf($result);
```

#### using use `array_walk_recursive()` method:

```php
$totals = [];
array_walk_recursive(
    $array,
    function($leafNode, $key) use(&$totals) {
        if ($key === 'total') {
            $totals[] = $leafNode;
        }
    }
);
printf($totals);
```

foreach is better way to do that even you can do a benchmark for performance you can have idea.

**Answers 2** : of How to get column from a multidimensional with nested key
The simple foreach should do the job, you could also write a function which takes a string as input, splits it and retrieves the values from the array.

It will only visit "**leafnodes**" so it spares you from needing to check if an element is an array or not.
