## How to access Java private field in Kotlin extension function

If I'd like to access Java's private field when using Kotlin extension function.

Suppose I have a Java class `ABC`. `ABC` has only one private field `mPrivateField`. I'd like to write an extension function in Kotlin which uses that field for whatever reason.

```java
public class ABC {
    private int mPrivateField;

}
```

the Kotlin function would be:

```kotlin
private fun ABC.testExtFunc() {
    val canIAccess = this.mPrivateField;
}
```
the error I'm getting is:

`Cannot access 'mPrivateField': It is private in 'ABC'`

## So here is fix to resolve this problem

First of all we will pick a Field from Java class then we will enable that field to make it accessible from Kotlin code.

### Example:

```kotlin
val field = ABC::class.java.getDeclaredField("mPrivateField")

field.isAccessible = true
```

Now we can read field value as Int using `Field#getInt` function from instance of our `ABC` class (declaring class).

### Example:

```kotlin
val it: ABC = TODO()

val value = field.getInt(it)
```

Now our extension method in Kotlin will look like this:

```kotlin
private inline fun ABC.testExtFunc():Int {
    return javaClass.getDeclaredField("mPrivateField").let {
        it.isAccessible = true
        val value = it.getInt(this)
        //todo
        return@let value;
    }
}
```
