Flutter is a mobile app SDK that allows you to develop high-quality native apps for **iOS** and **Android**. One of the most exciting features of **Flutter** is its support for creating custom widgets.

Sliver widgets are a special type of widget that is designed to be used with the **SliverList** and **SliverGrid** classes. In this article, we'll take a look at how to use sliver widgets in your Flutter apps.

In the past, creating a custom user interface in Android involved a lot of effort and know-how. You had to use different Layout classes and **ViewGroups** to achieve the desired look and feel. But with Flutter, all of that has changed.

Now, with the help of the **Sliver** widget, you can easily create custom user interfaces in Flutter.

## What is Sliver?

We've seen that ListView, ListView.Builder, and the GridView widgets all help us look at a list of things. But as we've seen, there is a distinct group of widgets also named sliver widgets. The sliver widgets are actually used to scroll through a list of items, but they also provide us with much more control than the less complicated widgets.

Flutter's Sliver Widgets are a powerful tool for creating stunning effects in your app. Here's how to use them to create amazing effects:

1\. Use the SliverList widget to create a list of items that can be scrolled through.

2\. Use the SliverGrid widget to create a grid of items that can be scrolled through.

3\. Use the SliverToBoxAdapter widget to place a single box in the middle of the screen that can be scrolled through.

4\. Use the SliverAppBar widget to create a floating app bar that can be scrolled through.

5\. Use the SliverPersistentHeader widget to create a header that remains at the top of the screen while you scroll through other content.
