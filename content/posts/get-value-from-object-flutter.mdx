In Flutter, you can retrieve the value of an object's property using the **`.`** operator.

    String name = person.name;

If the object is **`null`**, attempting to access a property on it will throw a **`NoSuchMethodError`**. You can prevent this by first checking if the object is **`null`** before trying to access its properties.

    if (person != null) {
      String name = person.name;
    }

You can also use the **`?.`** operator to safely access the property of an object. This operator will return **`null`** if the object is **`null`**, rather than throwing an error.

    String name = person?.name;

If you want to retrieve the value of a property on an object that may be **`null`**, using the **`?.`** operator is a good way to do it safely.

If object is Map type then you can get value by key value pair using \[\]. instead of '.' operator.

for example

    String name = persion['name'];

You can also use the **`?.`** operator to safely access the property of an object. This operator will return **`null`** if the object is **`null`**, rather than throwing an error.

for example:

    String? name = persion?['name'];
