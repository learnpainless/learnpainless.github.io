## what is Getx Flutter?

## How can Getx Flutter help create forms?

If you are looking for way to create forms using **TextEditingController** inside **StateLessWidget** then **GetX** can help you here. As you know we have to dispose TextEditingController after using it (when screen closes) to release memory, but in StateLessWidget there is no way to dispose form because **StateLessWidget** does't have any function to let us know that Widget is going to dispose. So if we use GetX then we can define our TextEditingController in GetX Controller and use inside our Widget and GetxController have method `onClose()` which will be called when our page close.

For example

**Getx Flutter** also supports validation, so you can be sure that your data is clean and consistent. Validation is done automatically, so you don't have to worry about it. Just sit back and let Getx Flutter take care of it for you.

So if you're looking for an easy way to create forms in Flutter, then Getx Flutter is the library for you. Give it a try today and see how easy it is to use.

## The benefits of using StatelessWidget

Flutter is a mobile app SDK that allows you to develop high-quality native apps for iOS and Android. Getx is a state management library for Flutter that makes it easy to manage your app's state.

StatelessWidget is a widget that does not keep track of any state. This means that when the widget is built, it does not need to rebuild its child widgets. This can be helpful if you have a widget that doesn't need to be rebuilt every time the parent widget changes.

StatelessWidget is also helpful when you want to cache a widget's build function. By caching the build function, you can avoid expensive computations when the widget is rebuilt.
