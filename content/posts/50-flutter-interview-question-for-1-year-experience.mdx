Are you looking for **Flutter interview question** for a 1 year experienced developer? Here are 50 commonly asked interview questions about the popular open-source UI framework – Flutter. Covering topics such as _Dart language fundamentals_, _state management strategies_, _best practices_, and more.

## 50 Flutter Interview Question

 1. **What is Flutter and how does it differ from other mobile development frameworks?**
    * Flutter is a mobile development framework created by Google. It uses the Dart programming language and allows for the creation of high-performance, visually attractive apps for both iOS and Android. It differs from other frameworks such as React Native and Xamarin in that it uses a unique rendering engine and includes its own widgets, rather than relying on native ones.
 2. **What are Flutter widgets and how do they differ from traditional mobile app elements?**
    * Widgets in Flutter are the basic building blocks of a Flutter app's user interface. They are similar to elements or components in other mobile development frameworks, but they are built using the Flutter framework and include a wide variety of customizable options. They are different from traditional mobile app elements because they are more expressive and offer more control over the app's layout and visual elements.
 3. **What is the Dart programming language and how is it used in Flutter development?**
    * Dart is a programming language created by Google. It is used to build mobile, web, and desktop applications. In Flutter, Dart is used to build the app logic and control the app's flow and behavior. Dart code is compiled ahead-of-time (AOT) into native code for both iOS and Android, providing good performance.
 4. **Outline the lifecycle of `StatefulWidget`?**
    * Creation: When a **`StatefulWidget`** is created, the framework calls the **`createState()`** method of the widget, which returns an instance of a separate State object. The **`createState()`** method is responsible for initializing the widget's state.
    * Initialization: The framework then calls the **`initState()`** method of the State object, which is responsible for initializing any resources that the widget requires. This is the first time the **`build()`** method is called.
    * Building: The framework calls the **`build()`** method of the State object to create the widget's visual representation. Every time the widget needs to be redrawn on the screen, this method is called.
    * Updating: When the widget's state changes, the framework calls the **`setState()`** method, which schedules a rebuild of the widget. When the rebuild is triggered, the **`build()`** method is called again, passing in the new state.
    * Destruction: When a widget is removed from the widget tree, the framework calls the **`dispose()`** method of the State object. This method is responsible for cleaning up any resources the widget used before it was destroyed.

      It's important to note that the setState() method can be called multiple times during the lifecycle of a StatefulWidget, but the initState() and dispose() methods are called only once each.
 5. **Can you explain the concept of "hot reload" in Flutter and its benefits?**
    * Hot Reload is a feature in Flutter that allows developers to see the changes they make in the code immediately in the app, without the need to manually stop and restart the app. This can greatly speed up the development process, as developers can test their changes and iterate on them more quickly.
 6. **Give me 4 advantages of using Flutter?**
    * Cross-platform development: Flutter allows for the development of apps for both iOS and Android with a single codebase, saving time and resources.
    * Hot Reload: With Flutter's "hot reload" feature, developers can quickly experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster.
    * High performance: Flutter's use of the Dart programming language and its widgets allows apps to run smoothly at 60 frames per second.
    * Customizable widgets: Flutter includes a rich set of customizable widgets, which allows for a unique and expressive UI.
 7. **Give me some limitations of Flutter?**
    * Limited third-party library support: The Flutter ecosystem is relatively new and still growing, so the number of available third-party libraries is limited compared to more established platforms like React Native or Xamarin.
    * Larger app size: Since Flutter includes all the required components to run an app in the app binary, the app size tends to be larger than native apps.
    * Limited support for older android versions: Flutter requires Android 4.1 or newer, which means it can't be used to support older devices running on Android 4.0 or older versions.
    * Limited developer pool: As Flutter is relatively new, the pool of developers experienced in working with the framework is relatively small, making it difficult to find developers to work on your app.
    * Complexity in handling platform-specific features: Some features may be harder to implement in Flutter as it only sometimes has direct access to platform-specific APIs.
 8. **When would you use profile mode in Flutter?**
    * Developers use profile mode to maintain debugging abilities and analyze an app’s performance while it’s tested. Candidates should know that compiling profile mode requires the flutter run --profile command.
 9. **What is Container class in Flutter?**
    * The **`Container`** class in Flutter is a convenience widget that allows developers to easily create a box with some padding and a specified width, height, and color. It is often used as a parent widget to hold and position other widgets.
10. **How does the layout and rendering process work in Flutter?**
    * In Flutter, the layout and rendering process is handled by the framework itself, rather than relying on the native widgets and layout managers of the underlying platform. This allows for more consistent and predictable behavior across different platforms. The layout is defined using a tree of widgets, with the root widget being the parent of all other widgets in the app. The framework then uses this widget tree to calculate the layout and paint the widgets on the screen.
11. **How does Flutter handle the issue of different screen sizes and resolutions on different devices?**
    * Flutter handles different screen sizes and resolutions by using a flexible layout system based on constraints and percentages, rather than fixed pixel values. This allows the widgets and layout to adjust to the available space and look good on any screen size or resolution. Additionally, Flutter provides a set of built-in widgets that can automatically adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios, such as the `AspectRatio` and `FractionallySizedBox` widgets.
12. **When should you use keys in Flutter?**
    * Can your applicants explain that keys are best used when developers want to preserve a modified widget’s state? They may also explain that developers can use keys to reorganize widget connections and widget trees, particularly when they contain stateful widgets.
13. **Explain why Futures are used in Dart?**
    * In Dart and Flutter, a **`Future`** is an asynchronous operation that can complete in the future with a value or an error. It represents a single computation or action that is not completed immediately but is expected to be completed at some point in the future.
14. **What are some best practices for designing and developing apps using Flutter?**
    * Some best practices for designing and developing apps using Flutter include:
    * Using the built-in widgets and layout elements provided by the framework, rather than trying to recreate them from scratch.
    * Following the Material Design guidelines for visual consistency and usability.
    * Breaking the app down into smaller, reusable widgets for easier maintenance and testing.
    * Using the provider pattern for state management.
15. **Explain what pubspec.yaml files are for?**
    * **`pubspec.yaml`** files are used in Flutter projects to manage dependencies. It is a configuration file containing the package's metadata, including the package name, version, and dependencies.

      The file lists the package's dependencies, including both the Dart packages and the assets that the package needs to run, such as images and fonts.

      When you run the **`flutter packages get`** command, it reads the **`pubspec.yaml`** file and downloads the dependencies specified in the file, making them available to your app.

      This file also allows you to specify the minimum version of the flutter sdk that your package supports and specify assets, fonts and other configurations.

      Additionally, developers can also use this file to specify the version of the package, the author, and other useful information when publishing a package on the Dart Package Repository.
16. **How does Flutter handle app localization and internationalization?**
    * Flutter provides a set of internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) libraries that can be used to support different languages and cultures in the app. These libraries provide support for loading localized strings, formatting dates, times, and numbers, and handling right-to-left languages.
17. **How does Flutter handle navigation and routing in the app?**
    * Flutter uses a navigation stack to handle navigation and routing in the app. Developers can push new routes onto the stack to navigate to new screens, and pop routes off the stack to navigate back. Flutter also provides a Navigator widget that can be used to manage the navigation stack and handle transitions between routes.
18. **How would you make sure you’re using all features of Flutter?**
    * Applicants should know that to make sure they’re making full use of all the features of Flutter, they can refer to the Flutter documentation and use different resources available online.
19. **What are some popular packages and libraries that are commonly used in Flutter development?**

You can also use external libraries such as **`dio`** or **`chopper`** for networking, they provide more advanced features like caching, request cancelation, retry and more.
21. **Explain what the setState() method does?**
    * The **`setState()`** method is a built-in method in Flutter that allows you to update the state of a **`StatefulWidget`**.

      When a user interacts with a **`StatefulWidget`** (e.g. by tapping a button), the widget's state may need to change. For example, a button's text may change from "Like" to "Unlike" when pressed.

      The **`setState()`** method is used to indicate that the widget's state has changed and that the widget should be "rebuilt" or "redrawn" on the screen with the updated state. The **`setState()`** method takes one argument, a callback function specifying the changes to be made to the widget's state.
22. **How does Flutter handle storage and database management?**
    * Flutter provides a built-in **`sqflite`** package for storing data locally on the device. It provides a way to store and retrieve data in a SQLite database. Additionally, there are other popular packages such as **`hive`** and **`shared_preferences`** that provide more advanced features for storing and managing data.
23. **Can you explain the concept of streams in Flutter and how they are used?**
    * `Streams` in Flutter are used to handle asynchronous data, such as user input or network responses. A stream is a sequence of asynchronous events. It can be used to listen to data and react to it as it arrives. In Flutter, streams are implemented using the **`dart:async`** library and can be used with the **`StreamBuilder`** widget to automatically rebuild the UI when new data arrives.
24. **How can we test our Flutter app?**
