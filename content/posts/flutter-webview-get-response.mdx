If you are using a Flutter WebView to display web content and need to capture the response from this content, you can use JavaScript for this purpose. This allows developers to communicate between their Flutter app and the web content that is being displayed in the WebView. With this method, developers can get responses and utilize them for various purposes such as user authentication or form submissions.

To get the response of a WebView in Flutter, you can use the **`WebViewController`**'s **`future`** **`evaluateJavascript`** method. Here is an example of how you can use it:

<Gist id='4e1026c190af9099120fe610203b285e' />

This will print the inner text of the body element of the web page in the WebView to the console when the floating action button is pressed.

Keep in mind that **`evaluateJavascript`** returns a **`Future`** that resolves to a **`String`**, so you need to use **`await`** when calling it.
