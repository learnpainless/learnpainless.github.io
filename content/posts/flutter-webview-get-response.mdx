To get the response of a WebView in Flutter, you can use the **`WebViewController`**'s **`future`** **`evaluateJavascript`** method. Here is an example of how you can use it:

<Gist id='4e1026c190af9099120fe610203b285e' />

This will print the inner text of the body element of the web page in the WebView to the console when the floating action button is pressed.

Keep in mind that **`evaluateJavascript`** returns a **`Future`** that resolves to a **`String`**, so you need to use **`await`** when calling it.
