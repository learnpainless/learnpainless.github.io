## Getting start with Kotlin

You can easily start coding in **Kotlin** online with the official **Kotlin
Playground** available [here](https://play.kotlinlang.org/). This will help you
to write some basic programs in **Kotlin**. After learning basic things you can
switch to offline **IDE** (which will work without internet).

Getting started with **Kotlin** is easy using the **Kotlin** plugin integrated
into **IntelliJ IDEA**. Benefit from *code highlighting*, *code completion*,
*refactoring*, *debugging*, and other features available for **Kotlin**.

If you want to start from scratch, you can build a basic **Kotlin** application.
Once you create the application, you can dive deep into the **Kotlin** syntax:

Add sample code from **Kotlin** examples

Install **EduTools** plugin for IDEA and complete practice with **Kotlin** const
course

If you already have a project build in Java, you can:

Start adding **Kotlin** code to your project.

Start with a small class or function with the required annotations for proper
spacing with Java code.

Write some tests in **Kotlin** for your code.

Tests are a safe place to add Kotlin to the codebase as they are not bundled
with your application during packaging.

Convert Java code to **Kotlin**.

Remove small bits of Java functionality and work using **Kotlin** classes and
**Java-to-Kotlin** converter.
