There could be a few reasons why the **Flutter** URL Launcher plugin is not working on **iOS**. Here are some things you can try:

1. Make sure you have added the **`url_launcher`** dependency in your **`pubspec.yaml`** file and run **`flutter pub get`** to install the package.
2. Make sure you have added the **`LSApplicationQueriesSchemes`** key to your **`Info.plist`** file, with an array value that includes the URL schemes you want to open. For example:

```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>googlechrome</string>
  <string>googlechromes</string>
  <string>http</string>
  <string>https</string>
</array>

```

3. If you are using the **`canLaunch`** method to check if the URL can be opened, make sure to add the URL schemes to your **`Info.plist`** file as described in step 2.
4. If you are using the **`launch`** method to open the URL, make sure that the URL you are trying to open is a valid URL and can be opened in a browser on your device.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if these suggestions do not solve the issue.
