To install an APK programmatically in Flutter, you can use the **`PackageInfo`** and **`PackageInstaller`** classes from the **`package_info`** and **`install_apk`** Flutter plugins, respectively. Here's an example of how you can use these classes to install an APK programmatically in Flutter:

<Gist id='f2355ff73ce88fbac22fc37e69438230' />

This example assumes that you have already added the **`package_info`** and **`install_apk`** dependencies to your **`pubspec.yaml`** file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
