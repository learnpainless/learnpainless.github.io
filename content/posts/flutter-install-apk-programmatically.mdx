If you're looking to make installing and running Android apps easier, Flutter is the perfect tool for you. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using Flutter to create and run Android apps programmatically.

To install an APK programmatically in Flutter, you can use the **`PackageInfo`** and **`PackageInstaller`** classes from the **`package_info`** and **`install_apk`** Flutter plugins, respectively. Here's an example of how you can use these classes to install an APK programmatically in Flutter:

<Gist id='f2355ff73ce88fbac22fc37e69438230' />

This example assumes that you have already added the **`package_info`** and **`install_apk`** dependencies to your **`pubspec.yaml`** file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
